DISCLAIMER:
This is not meant for any use at all
this was created as an educational project
despite being "complete" it still has many bugs.

To compile this simply run _\*_:
```bash
$ make
```

_\*_ Keep in mind that this requires you to have
make installed, it comes with most \*nix
OS these days

And to run the example program run:
```bash
$ ./main
```
